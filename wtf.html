	<h1>Matt Parker Knows All Of <span class="pi">π</span>‽</h1>
	<p>Well no, of course not. But <a href="/matt-parker-speaks-binary">Matt Parker Speaks Binary</a>. (Which is to say that Matt can take some text and rattle off the Ascii binary representation. But most people don't have access to Matt Parker so <a href="http://andrewt.net">me</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/stecks">Katie</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/lunasorcery">Luna</a> built <a href="/matt-parker-speaks-binary">a website to simulate it</a> by converting text strings to binary and then playing them back using voice samples from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSju5G2aFaWMqn-_0YBtq5A">Matt's videos</a>.</p>
	<h1>Matt Parker Knows All Of <span class="pi">π</span>‽</h1>
	<p>Well no, of course not. But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv3J9bNU0xc">Google thinks he does</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/standupmaths/status/1420691051157856257">he tweeted about it</a>.</p>
	<h1>Matt Parker Knows All Of <span class="pi">π</span>‽</h1>
	<p>Well no, of course not. But <a href="https://three.onefouronefivenine.com/">this website does</a>. Or rather, it uses a bit of code written by <a href="https://twitter.com/christianp">Christian</a> and based on <a href="https://three.onefouronefivenine.com/how.html">a bunch of maths I don't understand</a> to churn out effectively unlimited digits of <span class="pi">π</span> and I realised I could plug that code into <a href="/matt-parker-speaks-binary">Matt Parker Speaks Binary</a> and make  <a href="index.html">Matt Parker Knows All Of <span class="pi">π</span></a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/standupmaths/status/1420727711576756224">he tweeted about that too</a>.</p>
	<h1>Matt Parker Knows All Of <span class="pi">π</span>‽</h1>
	<p>Well no, of course not. The code works by <a href="https://three.onefouronefivenine.com/how.html">manipulating five integers over and over</a> to work out the next digit, and while the algorithm will work up to infinity, the numbers involved will get <em>very big</em>. And while in theory JavaScript's BigInt datatype should support arbitrarily large numbers, in practice your computer will eventually run out of memory. Although this website reads out the digits quite slowly so I'm not sure when it would ever become an issue.</p>
